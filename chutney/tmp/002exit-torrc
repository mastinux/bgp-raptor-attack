TestingTorNetwork 1

## Rapid Bootstrap Testing Options ##
# These typically launch a working minimal Tor network in ~20s
# These parameters make tor networks bootstrap fast,
# but can cause consensus instability and network unreliability
# (Some are also bad for security.)
AssumeReachable 1
# We need at least 3 descriptors to build circuits.
# In a 3 relay network, 0.67 > 2/3, so we try hard to get 3 descriptors.
# In larger networks, 0.67 > 2/N, so we try hard to get >=3 descriptors.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. or 3. are required to work around #11264 with microdescriptors enabled
# "The core of this issue appears to be that the Exit flag code is
#  optimistic (just needs a /8 and 2 ports), but the microdescriptor
#  exit policy summary code is pessimistic (needs the entire internet)."
# An alternative is to disable microdescriptors and use regular
# descriptors, as they do not suffer from this issue.

# 3. Optionally: Accept all IPv4 addresses, that is, the public internet

# 4. Finally, reject all IPv4 addresses which haven't been permitted
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
