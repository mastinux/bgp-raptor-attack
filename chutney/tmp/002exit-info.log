Jun 18 09:05:50.619 [warn] 'private:*' expands into rules which apply to all private IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. (Use accept/reject private:* for IPv4 and IPv6.)

Jun 18 09:05:50.619 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Jun 18 09:05:50.619 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!
