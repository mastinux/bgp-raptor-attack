TestingTorNetwork 1

## Rapid Bootstrap Testing Options ##
# These typically launch a working minimal Tor network in ~20s
# These parameters make tor networks bootstrap fast,
# but can cause consensus instability and network unreliability
# (Some are also bad for security.)
AssumeReachable 1
# We need at least 3 descriptors to build circuits.
# In a 3 relay network, 0.67 > 2/3, so we try hard to get 3 descriptors.
# In larger networks, 0.67 > 2/N, so we try hard to get >=3 descriptors.

## Always On Testing Options ##
# We enable TestingDirAuthVoteGuard to avoid Guard stability requirements

# We set TestingMinExitFlagThreshold to 0 to avoid Exit bandwidth requirements

# Speed up the consensus cycle as fast as it will go.
