Jun 18 09:05:50.670 [notice] Tor 0.4.2.0-alpha-dev (git-319ce225815897d8) opening new log file.
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] Tor 0.4.2.0-alpha-dev (git-319ce225815897d8) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.0.1f, Zlib 1.2.8, Liblzma N/A, and Libzstd N/A.
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to be safe at https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] This version is not a stable Tor release. Expect more bugs than usual.
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] Read configuration file "/home/mininet/mastinux-routing-attacks/bgp-raptor-attack/chutney/net/nodes/003client/torrc".
Jun 18 09:05:50.661 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Jun 18 09:05:50.661 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!

Jun 18 09:05:50.671 [warn] Your log may contain sensitive information - you disabled SafeLogging, and you're logging more than "notice". Don't log unless it serves an important reason. Overwrite the log afterwards.
Jun 18 09:05:50.671 [notice] Not disabling debugger attaching for unprivileged users.
Jun 18 09:05:50.671 [warn] This version of Tor was built without support for sandboxing. To build with support for sandboxing on Linux, you must have libseccomp and its necessary header files (e.g. seccomp.h).

Jun 18 09:06:04.891 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/3, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
