Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] Tor 0.4.2.0-alpha-dev (git-319ce225815897d8) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.0.1f, Zlib 1.2.8, Liblzma N/A, and Libzstd N/A.
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to be safe at https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] This version is not a stable Tor release. Expect more bugs than usual.
Jun 18 09:05:50.639 [notice] Read configuration file "/home/mininet/mastinux-routing-attacks/bgp-raptor-attack/chutney/net/nodes/003client/torrc".
Jun 18 09:05:50.661 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Jun 18 09:05:50.661 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!
